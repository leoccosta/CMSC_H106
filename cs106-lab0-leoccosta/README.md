### Lab Questionnaire

(None of your answers below will affect your grade; this is to help refine lab
assignments in the future)

1. Approximately, how many hours did you take to complete this lab? (provide
  your answer as a single integer on the line below)
  2

2. How difficult did you find this lab? (1-5, with 5 being very difficult and 1
  being very easy)
  2

3. Describe the biggest challenge you faced on this lab:
I was overthinking the enum and thought maybe I'd have to assign a date for each house and then have the program determine whether to print out based off that date instead of just having a switch statement (which I hope is what you were looking for).
